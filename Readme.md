# cbinsights-unicorn-scraper

This repo contains nodejs based scraper, for scraping data on Unicorn companies from [CB Insights](https://www.cbinsights.com/research-unicorn-companies). The script will create a file named `unicorns.json` in current working directory.

## Dataset

The data generated by script is refreshed every week (cron job using github actions). Thus, this data can be referenced by external scripts which need to consume regularly updated data. [dataset link](https://github.com/shubhamgrg04/cbinsights-unicorn-scraper/blob/master/unicorns.json).
