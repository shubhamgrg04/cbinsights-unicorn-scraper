# cbinsights-unicorn-scraper

This repo contains nodejs based scraper, for scraping data on Unicorn companies from [CB Insights](https://www.cbinsights.com/research-unicorn-companies). The repo uses github actions to scrape data once every day and update the data file  `unicorns.json`.

## Dataset

The data generated by script is refreshed every day (cron job using github actions). Thus, this data can be referenced by external scripts which need to consume regularly updated data. [dataset link](https://github.com/shubhamgrg04/cbinsights-unicorn-scraper/blob/master/unicorns.json).
