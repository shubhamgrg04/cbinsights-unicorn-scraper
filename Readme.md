# cbinsights-unicorn-scraper

This repo contains nodejs based scraper, for scraping data on Unicorn companies from [CB Insights](https://www.cbinsights.com/research-unicorn-companies). The script will create a file named `unicorns.json` in current working directory.

## Install

```
npm install
```

## Usage

```
node index.js
```

The most current output of the script is already saved in `unicorns.json` file and is regularly updated.

> I have also published analysis of this dataset [here](https://observablehq.com/d/30988e8d13372aa2).
